üõ† How the Project Works (Step by Step)
1. Citizen Reporting

User opens the mobile app.

Takes photo/video of the issue (pothole, garbage, streetlight, etc.).

Adds short description (or speaks ‚Üí voice-to-text).

Location is captured automatically (GPS).

Report is submitted.

2. AI/ML Processing

Image Analysis ‚Üí AI model checks if it‚Äôs a pothole, garbage, broken streetlight, etc.

Text/NLP Analysis ‚Üí Reads the description, validates issue type.

Duplicate Check ‚Üí ML compares with nearby reports to avoid spam/duplicates.

Priority Scoring ‚Üí AI assigns urgency score based on severity, keywords, and clustering (e.g., ‚Äúmajor accident‚Äù > ‚Äúsmall pothole‚Äù).

3. Blockchain Storage

Once verified by AI ‚Üí report metadata (report ID, type, location, priority, timestamps, reporter ID) is stored on blockchain.

Media (image/video) stored on IPFS / cloud storage ‚Üí hash saved on blockchain (immutability).

Blockchain ensures transparency + no tampering.

Smart Contracts automatically:

Assign report to correct municipal department.

Start SLA countdown (time limit for resolution).

Lock status updates (citizens can trust data is not faked).

4. Routing & Task Assignment

Smart Contract triggers ‚Üí sends task to department dashboard.

Example:

Garbage issue ‚Üí Sanitation Dept.

Pothole ‚Üí Public Works Dept.

Department staff see issues sorted by AI priority + blockchain timestamp.

5. Tracking & Notifications

Citizen gets a unique blockchain ID for their report.

They can check progress: submitted ‚Üí acknowledged ‚Üí assigned ‚Üí resolved.

Push notifications/SMS at each stage.

If SLA breached ‚Üí smart contract flags it, escalates to higher officials.

6. Resolution & Closure

Municipal staff fix the issue (clean garbage, repair road, etc.).

They upload before/after photo/video.

AI model verifies if issue looks resolved (e.g., pothole no longer visible).

Blockchain updates status ‚Üí resolution timestamp recorded.

Citizen notified + report closed.

7. Analytics & Insights

AI Dashboard:

Hotspot maps (areas with most issues).

SLA compliance rate.

Department performance (avg resolution time).

Predictive AI:

Forecast future civic issues (e.g., ‚Äúthis area likely to flood if heavy rain occurs‚Äù).
